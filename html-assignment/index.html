            <p> Hi&#33; My name is Lily and I&#39;m a recent highschool graduate pursing a design degree based in
                Canada&#46; Originally&#44; I planned on pursing a fashion business &amp; design degree but ultimately decided on a
                general design degree not only for more career opportunities&#44; but also monetary reasons&#46; Other than my
                interest in fashion&#44; I have no idea what I&#39;d like to do for a career&#46; I&#39;m hoping that this degree allows me to explore and figure out what in specific I enjoy&#46; <br> 
            </p>
            <!-- paragraph two -->
            <p> So far&#44; I&#39;m enjoying the <em> <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> &amp; <abbr
                        title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> </em> web development languages and graphic design the
                most&#46; But in the end&#44; my main career goal is to cater to my introverted self&#44; and be able to
                interact with the least amount of people whilst spending most of my time infront of a computer&#44;
                preferably at a home
                office&#46; From what I have learned so far&#44; it seems that coding &amp; freelance design jobs offer
                this&#44; keeping to private conversations amongst small teams or one client&#46; 
            </p>

            faults and my mistakes&#46; Tomorrow&#44; I might be a tiny bit wiser&#44; and that will be me too&#46;"
